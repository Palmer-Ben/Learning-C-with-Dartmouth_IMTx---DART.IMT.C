You have a number of loose matches that you would like to put back into boxes. Write a program that calculates and displays how many full boxes you will have and how many leftover matches you will have after filling all the boxes you can. Your program should take as input the number of matches to be boxed up followed by the size of a each box. Next it should print out the number of full boxes followed by the number of remaining matches.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    int num_box;
    int siz_box;
    int whole_box;
    int remain_box;
    
    scanf("%d",&num_box);
    scanf("%d",&siz_box);
    
    whole_box = num_box/siz_box;
    remain_box = num_box%siz_box;
    
    printf("%d\n",whole_box);
    printf("%d\n",remain_box);
    
	return 0;
}
